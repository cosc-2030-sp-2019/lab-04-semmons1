The strictest definition of a record expresses it as a linear, direct access data structure with diverse elements or components.
An example of how to build and use a record can be seen below:

Vehicle(manYear, make, model, mileage, aspirationType)

struct VehicleType
{
int manYear;
char make[30];
char model[30];
float mileage;
char aspirationType[30];
};

VehicleType vehicle 1;
VehicleType vehicle 2;
